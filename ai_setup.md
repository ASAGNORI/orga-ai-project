# AI Setup Documentation

## Overview
This project uses LlamaIndex and GPT-NeoX for AI capabilities. The setup is currently in a pre-integration state, with the necessary dependencies installed but not yet integrated into the application.

## Components

### Core AI Dependencies
- **llama-index** (v0.9.48): Data framework for LLM applications
- **transformers** (v4.37.2): Hugging Face Transformers library
- **torch** (v2.2.0): PyTorch for deep learning operations
- **sentence-transformers** (v2.2.2): For text embeddings and semantic search

### Optimization Dependencies
- **accelerate** (v0.27.2): For optimized model loading and inference
- **bitsandbytes** (v0.41.3): For model quantization and memory optimization

## Current Status
The AI components are currently:
- ✅ Installed in the Docker environment
- ✅ Version-locked for stability
- ✅ Cache directory configured at `/app/cache/models`
- ❌ Not yet integrated into the application
- ❌ Not yet configured for production use

## Docker Configuration
The AI setup is configured in the Docker environment with:
- Multi-stage build for optimized image size
- Non-root user for security
- Dedicated cache directory for models
- Version-locked dependencies
- Memory optimization packages

## Next Steps
To complete the AI integration:

1. Create AI service layer:
   ```python
   # Example structure (to be implemented)
   app/
     services/
       ai/
         llama_index_service.py
         gpt_neox_service.py
         cache_manager.py
         model_loader.py
   ```

2. Configure model settings:
   - Set up model loading and caching
   - Configure token limits and batch sizes
   - Set up error handling and fallbacks
   - Implement model quantization

3. Implement integration points:
   - Define API endpoints for AI features
   - Create data processing pipelines
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement caching strategy

4. Add environment variables:
   ```env
   # Required for production (to be added)
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/app/cache/models
   MAX_TOKENS=2048
   BATCH_SIZE=32
   MODEL_QUANTIZATION=4bit  # or 8bit
   ENABLE_MODEL_CACHING=true
   ```

## Resource Requirements
The current setup requires:
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- 10GB disk space for model caching
- GPU recommended for production (optional)

## Security Considerations
- API keys should be managed through environment variables
- Model files should be stored securely
- Input validation and sanitization required
- Rate limiting should be implemented
- Non-root user for container security
- Regular security updates for dependencies

## Development Guidelines
1. Use version-locked dependencies
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Include performance monitoring
5. Write unit tests for AI components
6. Use model quantization when possible
7. Implement proper caching strategies

## Testing
The AI components can be tested using:
```bash
# Run AI-specific tests
pytest tests/test_ai_components.py

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/test_ai_integration.py

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/test_ai_performance.py
```

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. Model loading failures:
   - Check available memory
   - Verify model files are downloaded
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify cache directory permissions

2. Performance issues:
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check batch sizes
   - Verify caching is working
   - Consider enabling model quantization
   - Check GPU availability if configured

## Future Improvements
1. Add model quantization for reduced memory usage
2. Implement streaming responses
3. Add support for multiple models
4. Implement A/B testing framework
5. Add model performance monitoring
6. Implement model versioning
7. Add support for custom model fine-tuning
